## The Problem

  * It's difficult for collectors to find the cards they need to complete their collection
  * It's difficult to keep track of which cards collectors have/have not

## The Solution

  * [ ] Wantlist (checkbox) for the all the cards a collector wants
  * [ ] Notifications when a wanted card is found anywhere on the internet
